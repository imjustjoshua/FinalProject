This file contains information about what port pins are being used for what.

Only the accelerometer has it's origional port pins from the project.

Sorted by Component used:

	Accelerometer:
		P1.5 - Xout for the accelerometer
		P1.6 - Yout for the accelerometer
		P1.7 - Zout for the accelerometer
		P1.3 - PushButton
	
	TI Calculator:
		P2.4 - The red wire on the serial IO cable.
		P2.5 - The white wire on the serial IO cable.
	

	MSP-MSP
		2.0 - The red wire on the serial IO cable.
		2.2 - The white wire on the serial IO cable.
	
	DAC:

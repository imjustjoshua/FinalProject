This file contains information about what port pins are being used for what.

Only the accelerometer has it's origional port pins from the project.

Accelerometer:
	P1.0 - Xout for the accelerometer
	P1.1 - Yout for the accelerometer
	P1.2 - Zout for the accelerometer

	These control the LED's on the accelorometer:
	P1.4 - LED controler blank: Enables input
	P1.5 - SPI clock
	P1.7 - Serial Input
	P2.0 - Xlatch

TI Calculator:
	P2.3 - The red wire on the serial IO cable.
	P2.4 - The white wire on the serial IO cable.

Serial LED Display:
